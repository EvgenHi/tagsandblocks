Statusbar for riverwm

Currently project doesn't have usable state. Signals doesn't work because they can't be received from sub-threads, so I'll have to turn the architecture upside down.

Though I still need an application like this, I'm not really interested in this project anymore. I am trying to develop a new application, but this time using bevy's ECS and ecosystem.

### Building

To build the project, run

```sh
cargo build
```

Or build and execute with
